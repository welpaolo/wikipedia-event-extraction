# Extracting Current and Historical Events from Wikipedia Exploiting Temporal Entity Co-References

Event extraction is a well studied task in the literature, we propose an approach that is solely based on co-reference of entities at a specific point in time that enables the discovery of events.

At the moment the code is under refactoring. 
We plan to release until January 2017. 

We release our result based on three different levels of connectivity.
